              <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
              <p>>Billie Eilish is an amazing person because she likes to see her fans happy. Billie Eilish also has an amazing soul because she puts others before herself because she rather see so much happiness go around other people and in the worrld. Yes, she might have depressing songs but I love how she shares her feelings with the world because other people in the world may have problems and this will just let them know that they aren't alone and that there is other people with the same thoughts.
